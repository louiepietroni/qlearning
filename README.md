# qlearning

This project involves firstly a neural network class which can be used to instantiate neural networks which are fully customisable in terms of layer sizes, activation functions and learnign rate.

An exmaple of creating, training and testing an XOR function are in main.py, as well as code to plot the output of the network.

balance.py has an implementation of the neural network for q learning
